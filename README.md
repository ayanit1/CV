Throughout my career I’ve always followed my desires and passion regardless how big or difficult the journey. Former professional dancer and business owner, I’ve decided to learn code at Makers Academy.

(skills learnt at makers?) Most importantly I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology.

The next step my journey is to become a full stack junior developer where I can be a part of a cohesive unit, and be creative in developing technical solutions to business problems.

## Skills

### Self-motivated

Before applying for Makers I wanted to firstly follow my passion in dancing and setting up a business. There is not a particular set guidelines to do both, yet with relentless tenacity I was able to learn and adapt new skills to keep them both a career, without the safe hands of someone above me. New skills meaning things like learning marketing skills in order to promote myself as a dancer or learning the basics of accounting so we are able to file correct reports for the business. I started everything from scratch which meant I had to do everything for myself.  I knew that working in a five star hotel would benefit me in the creation of my business so I worked there for a period of time. Now I know that I want to become a developer and I fully believe that Makers Academy would help me achieve that.

### Creative

I see myself as a creative individual. Dancing involves being creative with your body and creative visually. With the help of my business partner we had to come up with our own original designs with the creation of the shop and also marketing schemes. People came to watch me perform, and people came to my shop, both on a regular basis.

### Communication

Throughout my career I’ve always worked alongside with people. At my shop, I had a business partner and we had to fully communicate in order to have the business progress.

During my time at Makers  I maintained a blog about my experiences at Makers Academy which you can read here. (insert more)

### Team work and leadership

As a business owner I was required to not only manage and keep motivated a team of 5 employees, but drive the business in a direction where we could potentially expand profits and business. Being previously employed in a busy area like Oxford street allowed be more empathetic towards both employees and customers. Being employed in a five star environment taught me how to go the extra mile for people. During my dance phase, I was in the position to teach people who were unable to dance and develop their skills in the art form. This all simultaneously gave me direction in dealing with a spectrum of people in different situations, coming from different side. Conflict resolution and working towards the greater goal without ego is a common ethos of mine.
