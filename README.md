Throughout my career I’ve always followed my desires and passion regardless how big or difficult the journey. Former professional dancer and business owner, I’ve decided to learn code at Makers Academy.

The next step my journey is to become a full stack junior developer where I can be a part of a cohesive unit, and be creative in developing technical solutions to solve problems. I promote the use of Test Driven Development, with agile programming combined with extreme programming values.

## Skills

### Self-motivated

Before applying for Makers I wanted to firstly follow my passion in dancing and setting up a business. There is not a particular set guidelines to do both, yet with relentless tenacity I was able to learn and adapt new skills to keep them both a career, without the safe hands of someone above me. I started everything from scratch which meant I had to do everything for myself and solve problems that appeared.

### Creative individual

Dancing involves being creative with your body and creative visually. Also With the help of my business partner we had to come up with our own original designs with the creation of the shop and  marketing schemes. People came to watch me perform, and people came to my shop, both on a regular basis.

### Team work/pairing and leadership

As a business owner I was required to not only manage and keep motivated a team of 5 employees, but drive the business in a direction where we could potentially expand profits and business. Being previously employed in a busy area like Oxford street allowed be more empathetic towards both employees and customers. Being employed in a five star environment taught me how to go the extra mile for people. As a dancer, I was required to  teach people who were unable to dance. Makers Academy is designed to put students through the junior developer work environment so I am experienced in pairing and group project work, both I have been given good feedback in and also open to feedback in order to improve myself.

### Learning

I am confident in my ability to quickly learn any new technology. During my time at Makers, I learnt
